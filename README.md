#Description:
We developed a web application which acts a portal for communication and education and connects people all over the world where it addresses various humanitarian issues occurring everyday. 
This is important because there is Inequality experienced by people all over the world and a general lack of awareness regarding urgent humanitarian issues. 
There is also an inability of socially aware people to contribute effectively. 
For this reason, our web application acts as the solution to address the problem. 
It helps bridge the gap that causes people to experience inequality and help address these issues. 
It will also help educate the users and get issues more outreach.
